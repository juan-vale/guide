This project has been developed to provide a channel guide for the Kodi IPTV Simple Client
program. This guide will work without modification to the m3u playlist available from the IPTV Private Servers group. Other guides will work, but require modification to the playlist names.

The guide is obtained using the MC2XML program and pulls information from the Schedules Direct website daily at 1800gmt. Git Bash then reduces the size of the file to just under 50%, commits the file and uploads to this site. All of this is run in a batch file using Windows 7.
